These files allow to simulate strategies for the game can't stop by Sid Jackson.


CantStop.jl is a Module containing all the simulation tools. You should not need to modify it,
but are welcome to look into it. Let me know if there is a bug.
The main object in it is the game_state which represent all the informations available on the
game at any given time.

plot_position.jl is a helper file that allow you to visualize a game state.

Policies_42.jl is the file from which you should make your own Policies_xx.jl, where xx is 
your group number (found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k5a12aV4dwu36N7IRTr-jWsP9aYbbRaNNVsEQ3YoVJA/edit#gid=0). You have two functions (with the same name) per question. 
For each question, the first function take as argument a game_state object and a set of
admissible moves (given by the simulator), and should return the index of the move chosen.
The second function takes only a game_state and return a boolean stating if you stop or continue throwing.

Policies_666.jl is a copy of Policies_42.jl, that you can use to test a game with two players.

simulator.jl is the file you should run to test your policy. It contains example of what you can do.

If you have questions the Teams channel "Project" is there for you !
